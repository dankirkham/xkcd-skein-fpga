# Assembly Language

The assembly language specified here is used to abstract away the lower level machine-language instructions and to provide memory access. This contrasts to the ALU operations which have zero knowledge of memory addressing.

The assembler also serves to translate the logical address space to the physical address space. All assembly language instructions are high level, meaning they use the logical address space. All interaction with the physical address space happens under-the-hood by the assembler. 64-bit words are stored in RAM little-endian, 16-bits at a time.

## RAM Address Spaces
### Logical
The logical address space is the higher-level address space. It uses a 64-bit word size, which is the same as the Skein word size.

### Physical
The physical address space is the lower-level address space. It uses a 16-bit word size. It is necessary because the Spartan 6 block RAM is only 16-bits wide. (In 9K TDP Mode)

## Global Commands

Global commands are commands that do not pertain to a Core or RAM. They are for controlling unique modules where only one of such module exists. This uses 3 bits.

0. None
1. Increment Nonce - Once per hash
2. Best Nonce Module Save Selection - Multiple times per hash
3. Serial Transmit Best Nonce - Every N hashes
4. Constants ROM Output Enable
5. Nonce Module Output Enable

## Instructions

### Add
Adds the value stored in the Primary Register to the value stored in the Secondary Register and stores it in the Primary Register.

Syntax: `Add`

Implementation:

| Instruction | Address Bus        | RAM Write | ALU Opcode | Input Select | Output Select | Output Enable | Save Core Selection | Global Command |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| 1           | Don't Care         | 0         | 0x8        | Don't Care   | Don't Care    | 0             | 0                   | 0              |

### Constant
Loads a 64-bit word from the Constants ROM at the specified address to the Primary Register.

Syntax: `Constant <Address>`

Implementation:

| Instruction | Address Bus        | RAM Write | ALU Opcode | Input Select | Output Select | Output Enable | Save Core Selection | Global Command |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| 1           | \<Address>         | 0         | 0x0        | 00           | Don't Care    | 0             | 0                   | 4              |

### CoreId
Loads the Core ID from the Core ID Module and stores it into the Primary Register.

Syntax: `CoreId`

Implementation:

| Instruction | Address Bus        | RAM Write | ALU Opcode | Input Select | Output Select | Output Enable | Save Core Selection | Global Command |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |

### Count
Increments the Bit Counter Register once for each one bit stored in the Primary Register. This counts the bits in one 64-bit word. For actual bits-off calculation, the Bit Counter Register must be zeroed, and then a `Load` instruction followed by a `Count` instruction must be repeated 16 times (to count all 1024 bits). Upon completion, the counted value will be stored in the Bit Counter Register.

Syntax: `Count`

Implementation:

Implementation:

| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |

### Read
Outputs RAM value at specified address to the main bus. Note: This repeats `\<Address> * 4 + 3` twice on the address bus because of the way Core Sim works. Core Sim expects that address to still be output by RAM when checking a CoreSimAssert statement. This will not affect the real core.

Syntax: `Read <Address>`

Implementation:

| Instruction   | Address Bus            | RAM Write | ALU Opcode | Input Select | Output Select | Output Enable | Save Core Selection | Global Command |

### RotateLeft
Rotates left the value in the Primary Register and stores it to RAM. Since the ALU can rotate only 16-bits or 1-bit at a time, the machine-level implementation of this instruction can vary in length. For this reason, the "Instruction" column is replaced with a "Repetitions" column. **Caution:** The instruction voids the value stored in the Primary Register and Bit Counter Register. This is because the 16-bit rotations are actually RAM address manipulations and because of the "Rotate Primary Register Left 1-bit and Increment Bit Counter" ALU operation, respectively.

Syntax: `RotateLeft <Bits> <Address>`

Implementation:

### SaveNonce
Saves to RAM either the Primary Register or Secondary Register value, depending on the values stored in the Bit Counter Register and Comparator Register.

### SelectCore
Selects a core based on the value at the input of the cores, i.e. the main bus. A core that has a Core ID matching what is on the main bus will be selected. The "Read" assembly instruction will now work only on that particular core.

### SelectCoreNonce
Selects a core based on the value at the input of the cores, i.e. the main bus. A core that has a Core ID matching what is on the main bus will be selected. The "Read" assembly instruction will now work only on that particular core. This will make the Best Nonce Module select the core and begin its comparison loop.

Syntax: `SelectCoreNonce`

Implementation:
